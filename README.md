# Different-problems-different-codess
i will give you different codes for different problems
in first code reciept of a bill is made
in the second one the problem was
A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:
i. Hardness must be greater than 50
ii. Carbon content must be less than 0.7
iii. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600
The grades are as follows: Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met
A code which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.
the third is having this issue
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days the fine is 50 paisa, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be cancelled. A program  to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
all codes are written in c++ and having property of if else statement.
the last code named switch code is written in switch case format which is an alternative method to if else.
